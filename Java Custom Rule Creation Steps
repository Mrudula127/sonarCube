Writing coding rules in Java is a six-step process:
====================================================
1)Create a SonarQube plugin.
2)Put a dependency on the API of the language plugin for which you are writing coding rules.
3)Create as many custom rules as required
4)Generate the SonarQube plugin (jar file)
5)Place this jar file in the SONARQUBE_HOME/extensions/plugins directory
6)Restart SonarQube server
